# KNN_Algorithm
# PROJECT TITLE :
Make the prediction for "iris.csv" using KNN algorithm of Machine Learning, to find the value of K for Supervised Learning Clustering.
# TASKS :
1.By Default in KNN k=3
2.Host Data with sklearn
3.Split the data by train,test and client
4.Apply the classifier
5.Predict the model values
6.Check the Accuracy
7.If k=2 clustering called as ByLinear Clustering
